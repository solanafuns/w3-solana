# w3solana

w3-solana means **Web3 access protocol on solana** .

w3-solana provides a simple and easy way for developers and users to access resources on the chain, we'll call it w3solana for the time being.

## Why do we need w3solana?

Considering solana is already the largest and richest ecosystem of non-evm, due to the growing number of decentralized applications (dApps) and games running entirely on-chain. Developers can have a way to host their data without using external systems like IPFS, and users can more easily interact with on-chain data, helping provide a solution path for web3 to be adopted at scale.

## Why did we choose to build on Solana?

Because Solana's transactions are fast, gas costs are low, and Solana runs on an account-based model, which is a lot like a file system, and most importantly it's very friendly to raw data for protocol use.

## Repo parts

- w3

This code contains one cargo package which provides base program running on solana.

- gateway

It's a gateway helps get data by web3 url on solana.

- uplader

It's one tool upload static file data to our system.

## In the future

w3-solana will be more than just a tool in the future, it is a bridge between developers and customers on the Solana blockchain. It simplifies data hosting, enhances on-chain interactions, and leverages Solana's efficient blockchain architecture.
